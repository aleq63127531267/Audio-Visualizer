* Additions (major above, minor below)


1. make it so when uploading video files it can take the audio from it
2. “Experimental features” button (opens a menu like settings button)
3. language button to switch languages, it won't affect filenames and manually named layers
4. Global play/pause/stop buttons to toggle every layer.
5. new “multi gradient” coloring mode where you can make multiple gradients and just like the regular gradient coloring mode there's a bar but you can move the individual gradients across it
6. Visualizer: simply flashes the screen (based on average frequency if its too low it wont flash)
7. visualizer: “crystal wall” visualizer (similar to proximity dots), but the dots aren't visible, they connect if they are within a certain distance, whenever there is a closed shape with the lines connecting (triangle, 4 sided shapes, ect) and the shapes color is determined by the frequency or with its middle point. (ask about more detailed info if you are confused)
8. Add backgrounds, image, visualizer, etc (think more in depth later)
9. “Intensity” setting (changes how sensitive the visualizer is)
10. when opening the page it gives a short tutorial on how the site works, a window with text will explain with an x in the corner to close it and a continue button
11. a “refresh visualizers” button which will for example put the particles in particle visualizer in random locations again
12. moving, rotating, resizing (transforming) visualizers across the area
13. Live visualization of desktop audio as a separate button. Record audio button will have toggles on the side (mic, desktop audio)
14. Master volume slider on the side of the bottom UI


—————————————————————


1. new button to download currently uploaded sound file from selected visualizers
2. Add “select by type” button for layers (eg. with bars selected, selects all “bars, radial mirrored, radial linear” layers). Will only work if you have selected one or more layers of the same type.
